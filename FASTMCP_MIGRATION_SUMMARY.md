# FastMCP 2.0 Migration Summary

## âœ… Migration Completed Successfully

The Video Agent MCP server has been successfully migrated from MCP 1.x to FastMCP 2.0 (version 2.9.0).

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Dependencies
- **Updated**: `requirements.txt` - Changed from `mcp>=1.0.0` to `fastmcp>=2.0.0`
- **Added**: `dotenv` loading in `main.py` for environment variables

### 2. Server Structure (server.py)
- **Import**: Changed from `from mcp.server import FastMCP` to `from fastmcp import FastMCP`
- **Initialization**: Removed `description` parameter (not supported in FastMCP 2.0)
- **Tools**: All 17 tools successfully migrated with proper decorators
- **Resources**: 4 resources registered with URI patterns:
  - `project://current`
  - `project://{project_id}/timeline`
  - `project://{project_id}/costs`
  - `platform://{platform}/specs`
- **Prompts**: 4 prompts registered:
  - `video_creation_wizard`
  - `script_to_scenes`
  - `cinematic_photography_guide`
  - `list_video_agent_capabilities`

### 3. Import Conflicts Resolution
- Added `_impl` suffix to all tool implementation imports to avoid naming conflicts
- Updated all function calls to use the `_impl` versions

### 4. Prompt Return Format
- Updated all prompt functions to return `List[Dict[str, Any]]` format
- Changed from returning strings to returning `[{"role": "assistant", "content": content}]`

### 5. Environment Configuration
- Added `.env` file with FALAI_API_KEY
- Updated `main.py` to load environment variables using `python-dotenv`

## Running the Server

The server can now be run using:
```bash
uv run python main.py
```

Or as configured in `.mcp.json`:
```bash
uv --directory ./video-gen-mcp-monolithic run python main.py
```

## Benefits of FastMCP 2.0

1. **Better Organization**: Resources and prompts are now properly registered alongside tools
2. **Improved Discovery**: LLMs can better understand available resources and prompts
3. **Native Support**: Built-in support for the MCP protocol features
4. **Performance**: FastMCP 2.0 includes performance optimizations
5. **Future-Ready**: Access to new features as they're added to FastMCP

## Next Steps

1. Update any client code that depends on the old MCP format
2. Test all tools, resources, and prompts thoroughly
3. Consider adding more resources for better observability
4. Leverage FastMCP 2.0 features like middleware and error handling

## No Backward Compatibility

As requested, this migration does not maintain backward compatibility with MCP 1.x. All code has been updated to use FastMCP 2.0 patterns exclusively.
