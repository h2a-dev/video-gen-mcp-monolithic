This guide helps you create professional, cinematic visuals using AI image and video generation tools.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Camera Type Selection

### üì∏ FOR STILL IMAGES (generate_image_from_text, generate_image_from_image)

4. Add lighting and composition details
5. For video, include camera movement terms

## üé® Image Enhancement Workflow

When working with existing images, use generate_image_from_image to apply cinematic transformations:

### Example Transformations:
```
# Add cinematic lighting
generate_image_from_image("/path/to/image.jpg", "golden hour lighting, warm tones, cinematic color grading")

# Change camera perspective
generate_image_from_image(image_url, "shot with 85mm lens, shallow depth of field, bokeh background")

# Add atmosphere
generate_image_from_image(image_url, "add fog, volumetric lighting, moody atmosphere")

# Professional color grading
generate_image_from_image(image_url, "teal and orange color grading, high contrast, cinema LUT")
```
