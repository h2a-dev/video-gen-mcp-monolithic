## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

### 1. **Simple Video Creation (Recommended)**
```
Use prompt: video_creation_wizard("tiktok", "cooking tips")
```
This will guide you through the entire process step-by-step.

### 2. **Voiceover-First Workflow (RECOMMENDED for narrated videos)**
```python
# Create project
create_project("My Tutorial", "youtube", script="Your full script here...", target_duration=300)

# Analyze your script (includes voice recommendations)
analyze_script("Your script here...", target_duration=300, platform="youtube")

# Generate voiceover FIRST to establish timing
generate_speech("Your full script text", voice="Friendly_Person", project_id=project_id)

# Add scenes based on voiceover timing
add_scene(project_id, "Opening shot of kitchen", duration=10)
add_scene(project_id, "Ingredients close-up", duration=5)

# Generate visuals that match narration
generate_image_from_text("modern kitchen with cooking ingredients", project_id=project_id, scene_id=scene_id)

# Animate the images to complement speech rhythm
generate_video_from_image(image_url, "slow pan across ingredients", duration=10)

# Add background music at low volume
generate_music("upbeat cooking show music", project_id=project_id)

# Assemble everything ONCE (automatically mixes ALL audio tracks)
assemble_video(project_id)  # This creates the final video with all audio

# OPTIONAL: Create platform-optimized copy in exports folder
export_final_video(project_id, platform="youtube")  # Only if you need a separate export
```

### 3. **From Existing Assets**
```python
# Create project for your platform
create_project("My Video", "instagram_reel")

# Download your assets
download_assets([url1, url2, url3], project_id)

# Generate videos from your images (supports URL or local file)
generate_video_from_image(your_image_url, "zoom in with dramatic effect")
# Or from local file (auto-uploads):
generate_video_from_image("/path/to/local/image.png", "pan left slowly")

# Transform existing images
generate_image_from_image("/path/to/image.jpg", "make it more cinematic")
generate_image_from_image(image_url, "add warm sunset lighting")

# Add generated audio
generate_music("trendy upbeat music")

# Assemble and export
assemble_video(project_id)
export_final_video(project_id, "instagram_reel")
```

## üöÄ Parallel Generation for Maximum Speed

### IMPORTANT: Generate Multiple Assets Simultaneously
When creating multiple scenes, generate ALL videos at once by making multiple tool calls in a single message:

```python
# ‚úÖ CORRECT: Parallel generation (5x faster!)
# Call all these in ONE message:
generate_video_from_image(image1_url, "slow zoom in", duration=5, project_id=pid, scene_id=s1)
generate_video_from_image(image2_url, "pan left", duration=5, project_id=pid, scene_id=s2)
generate_video_from_image(image3_url, "zoom out", duration=5, project_id=pid, scene_id=s3)
generate_video_from_image(image4_url, "tilt up", duration=5, project_id=pid, scene_id=s4)
generate_video_from_image(image5_url, "fade in", duration=5, project_id=pid, scene_id=s5)

# ‚ùå WRONG: Sequential generation (5x slower!)
# Don't wait for each to complete before starting the next
```

### Why Parallel Generation Works:
‚Ä¢ All jobs run simultaneously on FAL's servers
‚Ä¢ 5 scenes complete in the time it takes to generate 1
‚Ä¢ Reduces total wait time from 5+ minutes to ~1-2 minutes
‚Ä¢ Works for images, videos, and audio generation

### Example: Complete Video Project in Parallel
```python
# Step 1: Generate all images at once
generate_image_from_text("scene 1 description", project_id=pid, scene_id=s1)
generate_image_from_text("scene 2 description", project_id=pid, scene_id=s2)
generate_image_from_text("scene 3 description", project_id=pid, scene_id=s3)

# Step 2: After images complete, generate all videos at once
generate_video_from_image(img1_url, "motion 1", project_id=pid, scene_id=s1)
generate_video_from_image(img2_url, "motion 2", project_id=pid, scene_id=s2)
generate_video_from_image(img3_url, "motion 3", project_id=pid, scene_id=s3)

# Step 3: Generate audio in parallel too
generate_speech(text1, project_id=pid, scene_id=s1)
generate_music("background music", project_id=pid)
```

## üí° Pro Tips

### Workflow Best Practices
‚Ä¢ **CRITICAL**: Use parallel generation for multiple scenes - call all generation tools in ONE message
‚Ä¢ **IMPORTANT**: Generate voiceover FIRST for narrated videos - this ensures perfect audio-visual sync
‚Ä¢ **CRITICAL**: When user provides reference image URL, use `generate_image_from_image`, NOT `generate_image_from_text`
‚Ä¢ Start with `video_creation_wizard()` for guided workflows
‚Ä¢ Use `analyze_script()` to get voice recommendations and optimize timing
‚Ä¢ Account for frame trimming: videos will be ~0.5s shorter per scene transition
‚Ä¢ Check platform specs with `platform://specs` before generating
‚Ä¢ Monitor costs in real-time with `project://costs` resource

### Cost Optimization
‚Ä¢ Use 5-second videos instead of 10-second when possible (50% savings)
‚Ä¢ Reuse images across scenes with different animations
‚Ä¢ Skip background music for sub-60 second videos
‚Ä¢ Generate voiceover only for key scenes

### Platform-Specific Tips
‚Ä¢ **TikTok/Reels**: Keep scenes under 5 seconds, use vertical format (9:16)
‚Ä¢ **YouTube**: Mix scene durations, add voiceover for engagement
‚Ä¢ **LinkedIn**: Professional tone, include captions for silent viewing

### Asset Management
‚Ä¢ Download assets immediately after generation to avoid timeouts
‚Ä¢ Use `download_assets()` for batch downloading with parallel support
‚Ä¢ Check storage with `get_server_info()` to monitor disk usage

## üí∞ Pricing Reference

### Generation Costs
‚Ä¢ **Images**: $0.04 per image (imagen4, flux_pro)
‚Ä¢ **Video**: $0.05 per second (kling_2.1)
‚Ä¢ **Music**: $0.10 per ~95 second track (lyria2)
‚Ä¢ **Speech**: $0.10 per 1000 characters (minimax)

### Example Project Costs
‚Ä¢ **30s TikTok**: ~$1.50-2.00 (3 images, 30s video, music)
‚Ä¢ **60s Instagram Reel**: ~$3.00-4.00 (6 images, 60s video, music, voiceover)
‚Ä¢ **5min YouTube**: ~$15.00-20.00 (multiple scenes, full production)

## üé® Reference Image Workflows

### When User Provides a Reference Image (URL or Local File)
Local files are automatically uploaded - no manual upload needed!

1. **For Local Files** - Just use the path directly:
```python
# User provides: "/home/user/photos/product.jpg"
# ‚úÖ CORRECT: Direct use of local file (auto-uploaded!)
generate_image_from_image(
    "/home/user/photos/product.jpg",  # Automatically uploaded
    "professional product shot with clean background",
    guidance_scale=4.0,
    safety_tolerance=5  # Default 5 for more creative freedom
)

# ‚ùå WRONG: Manual upload not needed
url = upload_image_file("/home/user/photos/product.jpg")
generate_image_from_image(url, "enhance lighting")
```

2. **For URLs** - Use directly:
```python
# User provides: "https://example.com/product.jpg"
generate_image_from_image(
    "https://example.com/product.jpg", 
    "product on white background with soft shadows",
    guidance_scale=3.5,
    safety_tolerance=5
)
```

3. **DO NOT use text-to-image** when reference is provided:
```python
# ‚ùå WRONG: Ignoring the reference
generate_image_from_text("product photo")  

# ‚úÖ CORRECT: Using the reference (local or URL)
generate_image_from_image(user_provided_image, "product from different angle")
```

## üéØ Common Workflows

### 1. **Social Media Short (15-30s)**
```python
# Quick engaging content
video_creation_wizard("tiktok", "life hack")
# ‚Üí 3-6 scenes, fast cuts, trending music
```

### 2. **Style-Consistent Content (with reference)**
```python
# User provides reference image
reference_image = "https://example.com/brand-style.jpg"

# Create project
project_id = create_project("Brand Video", "instagram_reel")

# Generate consistent images from reference
for scene in ["opening shot", "product showcase", "closing shot"]:
    img_url = generate_image_from_image(reference_image, scene, model="flux_kontext")
    add_scene(project_id, scene, duration=5)
    generate_video_from_image(img_url, "smooth camera movement")
```

### 3. **Educational Content (2-5min)**
```python
# Structured tutorial
create_project("Python Tutorial", "youtube", script=tutorial_script)
analyze_script(tutorial_script, target_duration=180)
# ‚Üí Clear sections, voiceover, supporting visuals
```

### 3. **Product Showcase (30-60s)**
```python
# Highlight features
create_project("Product Demo", "instagram_reel")
suggest_scenes(project_id, style="cinematic")
# ‚Üí Dynamic shots, professional look, call-to-action
```

### 4. **Story/Narrative (1-3min)**
```python
# Emotional journey
script_to_scenes(project_id)  # After adding script
# ‚Üí Scene variety, music sync, voice narration
```
