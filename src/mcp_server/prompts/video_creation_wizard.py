Welcome! I'll guide you through creating an engaging {platform.replace('_', ' ')} video about {topic}.

## ðŸ“‹ Platform Requirements for {platform.replace('_', ' ').title()}
- **Aspect Ratio**: {aspect_ratio}
- **Recommended Duration**: {format_duration(recommended_duration)}
- **Maximum Duration**: {format_duration(max_duration)}
- **Resolution**: {recommendations.get('resolution', '1920x1080')}
- **Frame Rate**: {recommendations.get('frame_rate', 30)} fps

## ðŸš€ Let's Get Started!

### Step 1: Create Your Project
I'll create a project optimized for {platform}:

```
create_project(
    title="{topic.replace(' ', '_')}_video",
    platform="{platform}",
    target_duration={recommended_duration}
)
```

### Step 2: Develop Your Script
For a {format_duration(recommended_duration)} video about {topic}, you'll need:
- **Opening Hook** (0-5 seconds): Grab attention immediately
- **Main Content** ({5 if recommended_duration <= 30 else 10}-{recommended_duration-5} seconds): Core message
- **Call to Action** (final 5 seconds): What should viewers do next?

Would you like me to:
1. Generate a script for you about {topic}
2. Analyze your existing script
3. Skip to scene planning

### Step 3: Scene Planning
Based on {recommended_duration} seconds, I recommend:
- **Number of Scenes**: {recommended_duration // 10 + (1 if recommended_duration % 10 >= 5 else 0)}
- **Scene Duration Mix**: {_get_scene_duration_recommendation(recommended_duration)}

### Step 4: Asset Generation Strategy
For each scene, we'll:
1. Generate an image that captures the key moment
2. Animate it with relevant motion
3. Add voiceover/music as needed

### Step 5: Production Workflow
Here's our production pipeline:
1. **Create scenes** with compelling descriptions
2. **Generate images** using AI models
3. **Animate images** into video clips
4. **Add audio** (voiceover and/or background music)
5. **Assemble** everything into the final video

## ðŸ’¡ Platform-Specific Tips for {platform.replace('_', ' ').title()}
{_get_platform_specific_tips(platform)}

## ðŸ’° Estimated Budget
For a {format_duration(recommended_duration)} video:
- Images: ~${0.04 * (recommended_duration // 10 + 1):.2f}
- Video generation: ~${0.05 * recommended_duration:.2f}
- Music (if needed): ~$0.10
- Voiceover (per 1000 chars): ~$0.10
- **Total estimate**: ~${_estimate_total_cost(recommended_duration):.2f}

## ðŸŽ¯ Ready to Start?
Let's begin by creating your project! Once created, I'll help you:
- Plan engaging scenes
- Generate stunning visuals
- Create smooth animations
- Add professional audio
- Export in the perfect format

Just say "Let's start!" and I'll create your project and guide you through each step.
